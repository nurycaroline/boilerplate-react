## Setup of your IDE

To maintain code quality and always have a standard across all of the team's
project has rules defined for javascript and css / scss. We use the Eslint /
Prettier for Javascript and Stylelint for SCSS. It is necessary to
integration of these rules with your favorite IDE. We recommend using Visual
Studio Code with the following plugins:

| Plugin    | README                                                                                     |

## Pre-commit

Before running git commit, the rules of ESLint and Stylelint are executed. If
there is an error or some non-default code of the site will generate an error
and you will not be able to commit.
